# Machine Learning: Minecraft Diamond Finder
This is the main repository for the Minecraft diamond finder model and environment declaration. 
See also the repositories containing the required plugin and premade server.

The model starts up a socket, listening for connections on localhost:5000, which the Minecraft plugin should connect to in order to establish communication.
